# Flask-SqlAlchemy-app

I'm basically just going through the [flask-sqlalchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/quickstart/#installation) docs.

## This README will cover...

- flask stuff
- flask with sqlalchemy stuff
- probably some poetry as well

## Running locally

```
export FLASK_APP=flask_sqlalchemy_app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Flask SqlAlchemy

- Upon adding SqlAlchemy, we have access to a class called `Model` that is a base we can use to declare models
- After creating a class

## Poetry

- Enter shell `poetry shell`
- Exit + Deactivate shell `exit`
